        <p class="top_message">"Out of water, I am nothing.""Surfing is attitude dancing.""My passion for surfing was more than my fear of sharks.""Being spat out of one of those giant, roaring Hawaiian tubes is the most amazing sensation I've ever experienced in my life. It's joy, fear and accomplishment all rolled into one experience.""Foam is your friend. Don't be scared of it. A little bit of extra foam here and there is good for the soul, and your surfing.""Surfing's one of the few sports that you look ahead to see what's behind."</p>

        <div class="para">
            <p class="main_text_1">Practice on the ground first. Attach the leash to your back foot and to the tail of your board, then lie belly-down on the board so that your body is lined up straight down the middle of the board. From this position, practice your paddling motion with both arms to get a sense of the muscles that you will be working.
            If you're right-handed, your back foot will generally be your right foot. This is called "regular" stance. It's called "goofy" stance when the leash is on your left foot. When in doubt, just do what feels most natural.
            Don't just jump into the water when you're first learning to surf, or you'll get frustrated quickly. Take a little bit of time to practice on the sand, or in the privacy of your backyard, before you're on the beach in front of others.</p>

         <div class="text_1">
           <p class="text_box_1">In one quick motion, push your body up with your arms and tuck your feet up and under you. Place one foot where your hands pushed up from and the other at least a shoulder’s width behind.
As you are beginning, you may find it easier to get up to your knees first and then bring up one foot at a time until you are in a standing position. It's slower than the jump up, but it works effectively for someone not ready for the jump up.[15]
Never grab the rails, or edges, of the board during your take off, unless you want to get a nice gash on your chin when your hands slip off your rail.
If you find your hands or feet slipping when you try to get up, you may need to rub more wax on your board.
You can practice jumping up without a surfboard present, so feel free to do it wherever you have a bit of space until you feel comfortable doing it.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="text_2">
          <p class="text_box_2">Depending on which foot comes naturally in front, you'll be either a "regular foot" or "goofy foot." Regular foot means that your left foot is in front, while goofy foot means your right foot leads.[16]
Beginners have a tendency to adopt a squatty stance when learning. Their feet are widely spread apart from bow to stern of their boards. This might feel comfortable, but it actually makes it harder to control. Balance is side-to-side, not front to back. You will notice that experienced surfers usually ride with their feet much closer together.
A proper stance includes keeping your eyes looking in the direction you are going.</p>
